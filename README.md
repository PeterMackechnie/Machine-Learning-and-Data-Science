A collection of Machine-Learning and Data-Science projects/investigations including:\n

1. 'Diamonds' - Unrefined vs Refined Regression models.
This investigation examines:
a. The potential of 5 different regression models to predict the price of round-cut diamonds.
b. The wisdom of using the performance of unrefined regression models to select which model to refine and use as the final model in a given situation.
