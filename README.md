# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science
A collection of Machine-Learning and Data-Science projects/investigations including:

1.1. Diamonds - Unrefined vs Refined Regression Models: This investigation examines the potential of 5 different regression models to predict the price of round-cut diamonds (from the 'Diamonds' dataset - see below), as well as the wisdom of using the performance of unrefined regression models to select which model to refine and use as the final model in a given situation.

1.2. Diamonds - Neural Network vs Regression Model: This investigation examines whether a model built using a Neural Network can outperform the best performing regression model (an Extreme Gradient Boosting regression model) from my prevoius investigation '1.1. Diamonds - Unrefined vs Refined Regression Models' when it comes to predicting the price of diamonds from the 'Diamonds' dataset.

The 'Diamonds' dataset:

Released in 2007, the 'Diamonds' dataset is a well known, easily accessible dataset that contains the price, as well as 9 other attributes (such as carat, cut, clarity, etc.), of 53940 round-cut diamonds sourced from the 'Loose Diamonds Search Engine'. Since its release, it has become a popular 'practice' dataset for those seeking to hone their machine-learning and data-analyses skills. It is most often used to practice data cleaning and preprocessing, as well as regression modelling, with hundreds of "Predicting the Price of Diamonds using Regression" notebooks having been created and uploaded to sites such as Kaggle over the years. The original dataset, of which this is a copy, can be found at - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds.
