1. 'Diamonds' - Unrefined vs Refined Regression models:
This investigation examines the potential of 5 different regression models to predict the price of round-cut diamonds, as well as the wisdom of using the performance of unrefined regression models to select which model to refine and use as the final model in a given situation.
